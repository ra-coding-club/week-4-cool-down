# Week 4 Cool Down

**Today's cool down consists of one (1) writing prompt. Good luck!**

**Prompt:** Write as much about your project as you can (at least one paragraph), and don't leave back any details. Pretend that you explaining your project to someone who has never used a computer and has never heard of the term Internet.

**Get Ready, Get Set... Get Typing!**
